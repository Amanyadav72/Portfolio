    <main>
        <p>I am a BSc IT student from University of Mumbai, interested in full-stack development 
            and cloud technologies. I am constantly learning and exploring new areas in tech.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a backend developer with a passion for building clean, scalable, and well-documented APIs. 
           I specialize in Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy, and I thrive in Linux environments where I can deploy, 
           troubleshoot, and optimize backend systems with precision. My projects—from task managers to guestbook 
           apps—are designed with real-world use in mind, and I’m constantly refining them to meet modern standards.
        </p>
        <p>I’m comfortable working across the full deployment pipeline: from writing efficient SQL queries to 
           configuring Nginx and deploying on AWS EC2. I’ve also explored cloud workflows using S3, IAM, and basic 
           EC2 provisioning, giving me a solid foundation for remote-ready development.
        </p>
        <P>Beyond code, I value clarity, collaboration, and continuous learning. Whether it’s refactoring legacy 
           logic or polishing a GitHub README, I bring methodical energy and a touch of humor to every challenge. 
           Currently, I’m focused on landing a backend internship or junior role where I can contribute to 
           production-grade systems and grow alongside experienced developers.
        </P>
